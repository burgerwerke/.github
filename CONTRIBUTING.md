Here's a checklist for opening a PR on [BÃ¼rgerwerke](https:/github.com/burgerwerke/) internal GitHub repositories.

- Include a link to the relevant Asana issue, if applicable.
- [ ] Do any architectural decision need to be recorded as an ADR? If so, submit one [here](https://github.com/burgerwerke/architecture) and link to it on this issue.
